** old programs written in older versions of the bunny library still compiling.
**
**
** So, consider things that are here as obsolete things.
** There is no removal planned, but no one knows in what the future is made,
** do not use anything that is here in your code.
**
** It also contains a few abstraction to port the bunny library on Windows.

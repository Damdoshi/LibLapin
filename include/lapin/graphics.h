** The t_bunny_clipable structure contains informations about a graphic element.
**
** It first contains a t_bunny_buffer with the height and width of the graphic element.
** It also contains four clipping fields: clip_x_position, clip_y_position, clip_width
** and clip_height.
**
** These clipping attributes are useful to select only a subpart of the graphic element
** to be used by functions. For example, bunny_blit will only copy the configured clip.
** By default, clip_x_position and clip_y_position are set to 0 and clip_width and
** clip_height to buffer.width and buffer.height.
**
** The attribute origin is useful to specify a hot spot. When blitting the graphic element
** to a specific position, for example, the origin define the point that will be drawn
** at the asked position throught the third parameter of bunny_blit.
** The origin also specify the rotation axis. By default, it is (0,0).
**
** Scale allow you to magnify or shrink the graphic element. The original size is multiplied
** by the scale to obtain the final size. By default, it is (1,1).
**
** The rotation is in degree and is the rotation of the graphic element when blitted.
** By default, it is 0.
**
** The color mask is a binary mask that will be applied to all pixel draw. By default,
** it is WHITE (0xFFFFFFFF)

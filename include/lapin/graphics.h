** The t_bunny_clipable structure contains informations about a graphic element.
**
** It first contains a t_bunny_buffer with the height and width of the graphic element.
** It also contains four clipping fields: clip_x_position, clip_y_position, clip_width
** and clip_height.
**
** These clipping attributes are useful to select only a subpart of the graphic element
** to be used by functions. For example, bunny_blit will only copy the configured clip.
** By default, clip_x_position and clip_y_position are set to 0 and clip_width and
** clip_height to buffer.width and buffer.height.
**
** The attribute origin is useful to specify a hot spot. When blitting the graphic element
** to a specific position, for example, the origin define the point that will be drawn
** at the asked position throught the third parameter of bunny_blit.
** The origin also specify the rotation axis. By default, it is (0,0).
**
** Scale allow you to magnify or shrink the graphic element. The original size is multiplied
** by the scale to obtain the final size. By default, it is (1,1).
**
** The rotation is in degree and is the rotation of the graphic element when blitted.
** By default, it is 0.
**
** The color mask is a binary mask that will be applied to all pixel draw. By default,
** it is WHITE (0xFFFFFFFF)

** The t_bunny_pixelarray is a graphic element that is convenient to
** access pixels per pixel. It contains a t_bunny_clipable attribute that does not
** have any effect by default. (Except the clipping attributes, but only if
** you draw on a window or a t_bunny_picture, not on another t_bunny_pixelarray)
**
** To activate the t_bunny_clipable of the t_bunny_pixelarray, you have to
** provide the functionnality by yourself, implement your own blitter and
** set the gl_bunny_my_blit pointer to your t_bunny_my_blit function.
**
** The pixels attribute is an array of pixels. The first pixels is the top left
** one and it comes line after line. The last pixel is to bottom right one.
**
** The library do not bring any functionnality to draw on pixelarrays,
** you have to implement your functions. There is a lot of gl_bunny_my_* function
** pointers that will activate bunny_set_* pixelarray functionnalities if
** correct functions are set to them:
** gl_bunny_my_set_pixel
** gl_bunny_my_set_disk
** gl_bunny_my_set_line
** gl_bunny_my_set_polygon
** gl_bunny_my_fill
** gl_bunny_my_clear
**
** The bunny_self_test function will help you by testing you functions after
** you set them to these function pointers.

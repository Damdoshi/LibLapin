  The <a href="http://hangedbunnystudio.com">Hanged Bunny Studio</a> splash
  screen. You can use it as an exemple of context. You can find a complete usage
  inside example/misc/splash inside the bunny library repository, aside
  the required ressources.<br />
  <br />
  You can also use it if you want to significate that you are using the
  bunny library. This would make us very happy. <br />

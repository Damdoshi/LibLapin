  Shaders can be use to produce special effects directly on the system
  graphic card instead of producing them with the CPU with a t_bunny_pixelarray.

  Graphic cards work incredibely fast compared to the main CPU when
  it cames to graphics.

  Shaders are programmed with the GLSL programming language, which is
  syntaxically close to C but have its specificities.<br />
  You can find example of shaders in the LibLapin repository.

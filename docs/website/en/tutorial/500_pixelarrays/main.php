  The t_bunny_pixelarray type is a structure that represents CPU computed pictures.
  CPU computed means fully made by hand, by your program.<br />
  <br />
  Today, it is very rare to work by hand when it came to pixel drawing, but
  it is very trainer and sometimes, it is neccessary. It may also be a very
  essential experience when writing fragment shaders.<br />
  <br />
  In this chapter, you will not find simple tutorials to use the bunny library
  but series of exercices and projects to achieve using it. A lot of them
  may not be directly linked to the usage of the bunny library but they are
  all linked to graphic programming.<br />
  <br />
  More than a tutorial for bunny library, this chapter is school.<br />

  The Bunny Library was originally designed as an educational project and
  was proposed and accept by a french computing school. The legacy of this
  period is mainly present in the t_bunny_pixelarray which is still the same:
  no functions are designed for it so all treatments have to be programmed
  by the user throught a serie of projects.<br />
  This chapter keep this spirit.

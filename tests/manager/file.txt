In case you wonder:

- I don't care having pointers and allocations in C or C++.
- I don't care about your flash/javascript/lua/java/Csharp ability to garbage collect.
- I don't care "this is much simpler in any other language".

You can use any language, I will still go faster than you with C.
Your ability to go faster with other language is mainly a proof of your incompetence in C, it is nothing because of the C language itself.

My language are C and C++, I am not as efficient with other.
So, use your language, any engine because I bet you use one, like Unity, and stop bother me.

Thank you

TMX Map Format
==============

**Version 1.1**

The TMX (Tile Map XML) map format used by
`Tiled <http://www.mapeditor.org>`__ is a flexible way to describe a
tile based map. It can describe maps with any tile size, any amount of
layers, any number of tile sets and it allows custom properties to be
set on most elements. Beside tile layers, it can also contain groups of
objects that can be placed freely.

Note that there are many :doc:`libraries and frameworks <support-for-tmx-maps>`
available that can work with TMX maps.

In this document we'll go through each element found in this map format.
The elements are mentioned in the headers and the list of attributes of
the elements are listed right below, followed by a short explanation.
Attributes or elements that are deprecated or unsupported by the current
version of Tiled are formatted in italics.

Have a look at the :doc:`changelog <tmx-changelog>` when you're
interested in what changed between Tiled versions.

*A DTD-file (Document Type Definition) is served at
http://mapeditor.org/dtd/1.0/map.dtd. This file is not up-to-date but
might be useful for XML-namespacing anyway.*

.. _tmx-map:

<map>
-----

-  **version:** The TMX format version. Was "1.0" so far, and will be
   incremented to match minor Tiled releases.
-  **tiledversion:** The Tiled version used to save the file (since Tiled
   1.0.1). May be a date (for snapshot builds).
-  **orientation:** Map orientation. Tiled supports "orthogonal",
   "isometric", "staggered" and "hexagonal" (since 0.11).
-  **renderorder:** The order in which tiles on tile layers are rendered.
   Valid values are ``right-down`` (the default), ``right-up``,
   ``left-down`` and ``left-up``. In all cases, the map is drawn
   row-by-row. (only supported for orthogonal maps at the moment)
-  **width:** The map width in tiles.
-  **height:** The map height in tiles.
-  **tilewidth:** The width of a tile.
-  **tileheight:** The height of a tile.
-  **hexsidelength:** Only for hexagonal maps. Determines the width or
   height (depending on the staggered axis) of the tile's edge, in
   pixels.
-  **staggeraxis:** For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines which axis
   ("x" or "y") is staggered. (since 0.11)
-  **staggerindex:** For staggered and hexagonal maps, determines whether
   the "even" or "odd" indexes along the staggered axis are shifted.
   (since 0.11)
-  **backgroundcolor:** The background color of the map. (optional, may
   include alpha value since 0.15 in the form ``#AARRGGBB``)
-  **nextobjectid:** Stores the next available ID for new objects. This
   number is stored to prevent reuse of the same ID after objects have
   been removed. (since 0.11)

The ``tilewidth`` and ``tileheight`` properties determine the general
grid size of the map. The individual tiles may have different sizes.
Larger tiles will extend at the top and right (anchored to the bottom
left).

A map contains three different kinds of layers. Tile layers were once
the only type, and are simply called ``layer``, object layers have the
``objectgroup`` tag and image layers use the ``imagelayer`` tag. The
order in which these layers appear is the order in which the layers are
rendered by Tiled.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-tileset`,
:ref:`tmx-layer`, :ref:`tmx-objectgroup`,
:ref:`tmx-imagelayer`, :ref:`tmx-group` (since 1.0)

.. _tmx-tileset:

<tileset>
---------

-  **firstgid:** The first global tile ID of this tileset (this global ID
   maps to the first tile in this tileset).
-  **source:** If this tileset is stored in an external TSX (Tile Set XML)
   file, this attribute refers to that file. That TSX file has the same
   structure as the ``<tileset>`` element described here. (There is the
   firstgid attribute missing and this source attribute is also not
   there. These two attributes are kept in the TMX map, since they are
   map specific.)
-  **name:** The name of this tileset.
-  **tilewidth:** The (maximum) width of the tiles in this tileset.
-  **tileheight:** The (maximum) height of the tiles in this tileset.
-  **spacing:** The spacing in pixels between the tiles in this tileset
   (applies to the tileset image).
-  **margin:** The margin around the tiles in this tileset (applies to the
   tileset image).
-  **tilecount:** The number of tiles in this tileset (since 0.13)
-  **columns:** The number of tile columns in the tileset. For image
   collection tilesets it is editable and is used when displaying the
   tileset. (since 0.15)

If there are multiple ``<tileset>`` elements, they are in ascending
order of their ``firstgid`` attribute. The first tileset always has a
``firstgid`` value of 1. Since Tiled 0.15, image collection tilesets do
not necessarily number their tiles consecutively since gaps can occur
when removing tiles.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-tileoffset`, :ref:`tmx-properties`,
:ref:`tmx-image`, :ref:`tmx-terraintypes`,
:ref:`tmx-tileset-tile`, :ref:`tmx-wangsets` (since 1.1)

.. _tmx-tileoffset:

<tileoffset>
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **x:** Horizontal offset in pixels
-  **y:** Vertical offset in pixels (positive is down)

This element is used to specify an offset in pixels, to be applied when
drawing a tile from the related tileset. When not present, no offset is
applied.

.. _tmx-image:

<image>
~~~~~~~

-  **format:** Used for embedded images, in combination with a ``data``
   child element. Valid values are file extensions like ``png``,
   ``gif``, ``jpg``, ``bmp``, etc.
-  *id:* Used by some versions of Tiled Java. Deprecated and unsupported
   by Tiled Qt.
-  **source:** The reference to the tileset image file (Tiled supports most
   common image formats).
-  **trans:** Defines a specific color that is treated as transparent
   (example value: "#FF00FF" for magenta). Up until Tiled 0.12, this
   value is written out without a ``#`` but this is planned to change.
-  **width:** The image width in pixels (optional, used for tile index
   correction when the image changes)
-  **height:** The image height in pixels (optional)

Note that it is not currently possible to use Tiled to create maps with
embedded image data, even though the TMX format supports this. It is
possible to create such maps using ``libtiled`` (Qt/C++) or
`tmxlib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tmxlib>`__ (Python).

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-data`

.. _tmx-terraintypes:

   given as comma-separated indexes in the terrain types array in the
   order top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Leaving out a
   value means that corner has no terrain. (optional)
-  **probability:** A percentage indicating the probability that this
   tile is chosen when it competes with others while editing with the
   terrain tool. (optional)

   in the format ``0xCECECECE`` (where each C is a corner color and
   each E is an edge color, from right to left clockwise, starting with
   the top edge)

.. _tmx-layer:

<layer>
-------

All ``<tileset>`` tags shall occur before the first ``<layer>`` tag so
that parsers may rely on having the tilesets before needing to resolve
tiles.

-  **name:** The name of the layer.
-  *x:* The x coordinate of the layer in tiles. Defaults to 0 and can not be changed in Tiled.
-  *y:* The y coordinate of the layer in tiles. Defaults to 0 and can not be changed in Tiled.
-  **width:** The width of the layer in tiles. Always the same as the map width for fixed-size maps.

-  **offsetx:** Rendering offset for this layer in pixels. Defaults to 0.
   (since 0.14)
-  **offsety:** Rendering offset for this layer in pixels. Defaults to 0.
   (since 0.14)

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-data`

.. _tmx-data:

<data>
~~~~~~

-  **encoding:** The encoding used to encode the tile layer data. When used,
   it can be "base64" and "csv" at the moment.
-  **compression:** The compression used to compress the tile layer data.
   Tiled supports "gzip" and "zlib".

When no encoding or compression is given, the tiles are stored as
individual XML ``tile`` elements. Next to that, the easiest format to
parse is the "csv" (comma separated values) format.

The base64-encoded and optionally compressed layer data is somewhat more
complicated to parse. First you need to base64-decode it, then you may
need to decompress it. Now you have an array of bytes, which should be
interpreted as an array of unsigned 32-bit integers using little-endian
byte ordering.

Whatever format you choose for your layer data, you will always end up
with so called "global tile IDs" (gids). They are global, since they may
refer to a tile from any of the tilesets used by the map. In order to
find out from which tileset the tile is you need to find the tileset
with the highest ``firstgid`` that is still lower or equal than the gid.
The tilesets are always stored with increasing ``firstgid``\ s.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-tilelayer-tile`, :ref:`tmx-chunk`

Tile flipping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The highest three bits of the gid store the flipped states. Bit 32 is
used for storing whether the tile is horizontally flipped, bit 31 is
used for the vertically flipped tiles and bit 30 indicates whether the
tile is flipped (anti) diagonally, enabling tile rotation. These bits
have to be read and cleared before you can find out which tileset a tile
belongs to.

When rendering a tile, the order of operation matters. The diagonal flip
(x/y axis swap) is done first, followed by the horizontal and vertical
flips.

The following C++ pseudo-code should make it all clear:

.. code:: cpp

   // Bits on the far end of the 32-bit global tile ID are used for tile flags
   const unsigned FLIPPED_HORIZONTALLY_FLAG = 0x80000000;
   const unsigned FLIPPED_VERTICALLY_FLAG   = 0x40000000;
   const unsigned FLIPPED_DIAGONALLY_FLAG   = 0x20000000;

   ...

   // Extract the contents of the <data> element
   string tile_data = ...

   unsigned char *data = decompress(base64_decode(tile_data));
   unsigned tile_index = 0;

   // Here you should check that the data has the right size
   // (map_width * map_height * 4)

   for (int y = 0; y < map_height; ++y) {
     for (int x = 0; x < map_width; ++x) {
       unsigned global_tile_id = data[tile_index] |
                                 data[tile_index + 1] << 8 |
                                 data[tile_index + 2] << 16 |
                                 data[tile_index + 3] << 24;
       tile_index += 4;

       // Read out the flags
       bool flipped_horizontally = (global_tile_id & FLIPPED_HORIZONTALLY_FLAG);
       bool flipped_vertically = (global_tile_id & FLIPPED_VERTICALLY_FLAG);
       bool flipped_diagonally = (global_tile_id & FLIPPED_DIAGONALLY_FLAG);

       // Clear the flags
       global_tile_id &= ~(FLIPPED_HORIZONTALLY_FLAG |
                           FLIPPED_VERTICALLY_FLAG |
                           FLIPPED_DIAGONALLY_FLAG);

       // Resolve the tile
       for (int i = tileset_count - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
         Tileset *tileset = tilesets[i];

         if (tileset->first_gid() <= global_tile_id) {
           tiles[y][x] = tileset->tileAt(global_tile_id - tileset->first_gid());
           break;
         }
       }
     }
   }

(Since the above code was put together on this wiki page and can't be
directly tested, please make sure to report any errors you encounter
when basing your parsing code on it, thanks.)

.. _tmx-chunk:

<chunk>
~~~~~~~

-  **x:** The x coordinate of the chunk in tiles.
-  **y:** The y coordinate of the chunk in tiles.
-  **width:** The width of the chunk in tiles.
-  **height:** The height of the chunk in tiles.

This is currently added only for infinite maps. The contents of a chunk
element is same as that of the ``data`` element, except it stores the
data of the area specified in the attributes.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-tilelayer-tile`

.. _tmx-tilelayer-tile:

<tile>
~~~~~~

-  **gid:** The global tile ID (default: 0).

Not to be confused with the ``tile`` element inside a ``tileset``, this
element defines the value of a single tile on a tile layer. This is
however the most inefficient way of storing the tile layer data, and
should generally be avoided.

.. _tmx-objectgroup:

<objectgroup>
-------------

-  **name:** The name of the object group.
-  **color:** The color used to display the objects in this group.
-  *x:* The x coordinate of the object group in tiles. Defaults to 0 and
   can no longer be changed in Tiled.
-  *y:* The y coordinate of the object group in tiles. Defaults to 0 and
   can no longer be changed in Tiled.
-  *width:* The width of the object group in tiles. Meaningless.
-  *height:* The height of the object group in tiles. Meaningless.
-  **opacity:** The opacity of the layer as a value from 0 to 1. Defaults to
   1.
-  **visible:** Whether the layer is shown (1) or hidden (0). Defaults to 1.
-  **offsetx:** Rendering offset for this object group in pixels. Defaults
   to 0. (since 0.14)
-  **offsety:** Rendering offset for this object group in pixels. Defaults
   to 0. (since 0.14)
-  **draworder:** Whether the objects are drawn according to the order of
   appearance ("index") or sorted by their y-coordinate ("topdown").
   Defaults to "topdown".

The object group is in fact a map layer, and is hence called "object
layer" in Tiled.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-object`

.. _tmx-object:

<object>
~~~~~~~~

-  **id:** Unique ID of the object. Each object that is placed on a map gets
   a unique id. Even if an object was deleted, no object gets the same
   ID. Can not be changed in Tiled. (since Tiled 0.11)
-  **name:** The name of the object. An arbitrary string.
-  **type:** The type of the object. An arbitrary string.
-  **x:** The x coordinate of the object in pixels.
-  **y:** The y coordinate of the object in pixels.
-  **width:** The width of the object in pixels (defaults to 0).
-  **height:** The height of the object in pixels (defaults to 0).
-  **rotation:** The rotation of the object in degrees clockwise (defaults
   to 0).
-  **gid:** A reference to a tile (optional).
-  **visible:** Whether the object is shown (1) or hidden (0). Defaults to
   1.
-  **template:** A reference to a :ref:`template file <tmx-template-files>` (optional).

While tile layers are very suitable for anything repetitive aligned to
the tile grid, sometimes you want to annotate your map with other
information, not necessarily aligned to the grid. Hence the objects have
their coordinates and size in pixels, but you can still easily align
that to the grid when you want to.

You generally use objects to add custom information to your tile map,
such as spawn points, warps, exits, etc.

When the object has a ``gid`` set, then it is represented by the image
of the tile with that global ID. The image alignment currently depends
on the map orientation. In orthogonal orientation it's aligned to the
bottom-left while in isometric it's aligned to the bottom-center.

When the object has a ``template`` set, it will borrow all the
properties from the specified template, properties saved with the object
will have higher priority, i.e. they will override the template
properties.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-ellipse` (since
0.9), :ref:`tmx-polygon`, :ref:`tmx-polyline`, :ref:`tmx-text`
(since 1.0), *image*

.. _tmx-ellipse:

<ellipse>
~~~~~~~~~

Used to mark an object as an ellipse. The existing ``x``, ``y``,
``width`` and ``height`` attributes are used to determine the size of
the ellipse.

.. _tmx-point:

<point>
~~~~~~~~~

Used to mark an object as a point. The existing ``x`` and ``y`` attributes
are used to determine the position of the point.

.. _tmx-polygon:

<polygon>
~~~~~~~~~

-  **points:** A list of x,y coordinates in pixels.

Each ``polygon`` object is made up of a space-delimited list of x,y
coordinates. The origin for these coordinates is the location of the
parent ``object``. By default, the first point is created as 0,0
denoting that the point will originate exactly where the ``object`` is
placed.

.. _tmx-polyline:

<polyline>
~~~~~~~~~~

-  **points:** A list of x,y coordinates in pixels.

A ``polyline`` follows the same placement definition as a ``polygon``
object.

.. _tmx-text:

<text>
~~~~~~

-  **fontfamily:** The font family used (default: "sans-serif")
-  **pixelsize:** The size of the font in pixels (not using points,
   because other sizes in the TMX format are also using pixels)
   (default: 16)
-  **wrap:** Whether word wrapping is enabled (1) or disabled (0).
   Defaults to 0.
-  **color:** Color of the text in ``#AARRGGBB`` or ``#RRGGBB`` format
   (default: #000000)
-  **bold:** Whether the font is bold (1) or not (0). Defaults to 0.
-  **italic:** Whether the font is italic (1) or not (0). Defaults to 0.
-  **underline:** Whether a line should be drawn below the text (1) or
   not (0). Defaults to 0.
-  **strikeout:** Whether a line should be drawn through the text (1) or
   not (0). Defaults to 0.
-  **kerning:** Whether kerning should be used while rendering the text
   (1) or not (0). Default to 1.
-  **halign:** Horizontal alignment of the text within the object
   (``left`` (default), ``center`` or ``right``)
-  **valign:** Vertical alignment of the text within the object (``top``
   (default), ``center`` or ``bottom``)

Used to mark an object as a text object. Contains the actual text as
character data.

.. _tmx-imagelayer:

<imagelayer>
------------

-  **name:** The name of the image layer.
-  **offsetx:** Rendering offset of the image layer in pixels. Defaults to
   0. (since 0.15)

   0. (since 0.15)
-  *x:* The x position of the image layer in pixels. (deprecated since
   0.15)
-  *y:* The y position of the image layer in pixels. (deprecated since
   0.15)
-  **opacity:** The opacity of the layer as a value from 0 to 1. Defaults to
   1.
-  **visible:** Whether the layer is shown (1) or hidden (0). Defaults to 1.

A layer consisting of a single image.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-image`

.. _tmx-group:

<group>
-------

-  **name:** The name of the group layer.

   0.
-  **opacity:** The opacity of the layer as a value from 0 to 1. Defaults to
   1.
-  **visible:** Whether the layer is shown (1) or hidden (0). Defaults to 1.

A group layer, used to organize the layers of the map in a hierarchy.
Its attributes ``offsetx``, ``offsety``, ``opacity`` and ``visible``
recursively affect child layers.

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-properties`, :ref:`tmx-layer`,
:ref:`tmx-objectgroup`, :ref:`tmx-imagelayer`, :ref:`tmx-group`

.. _tmx-properties:

<properties>
------------

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-property`

Wraps any number of custom properties. Can be used as a child of the
``map``, ``tileset``, ``tile`` (when part of a ``tileset``),
``terrain``, ``layer``, ``objectgroup``, ``object``, ``imagelayer`` and
``group`` elements.

.. _tmx-property:

<property>
~~~~~~~~~~

-  **name:** The name of the property.
-  **type:** The type of the property. Can be ``string`` (default), ``int``,
   ``float``, ``bool``, ``color`` or ``file`` (since 0.16, with
   ``color`` and ``file`` added in 0.17).
-  **value:** The value of the property.

Boolean properties have a value of either "true" or "false".

Color properties are stored in the format ``#AARRGGBB``.

File properties are stored as paths relative from the location of the
map file.

When a string property contains newlines, the current version of Tiled
will write out the value as characters contained inside the ``property``
element rather than as the ``value`` attribute. It is possible that a
future version of the TMX format will switch to always saving property
values inside the element rather than as an attribute.

.. _tmx-template-files:

Template Files
--------------

Templates are saved in their own file, and are referenced by
:ref:`objects <tmx-object>` that are template instances.

.. _tmx-template:

<template>
~~~~~~~~~~

The template root element contains the saved :ref:`map object <tmx-object>`
and a :ref:`tileset <tmx-tileset>` element that points to an external
tileset, if the object is a tile object.

Example of a template file:

   .. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <template>
     <tileset firstgid="1" source="desert.tsx"/>
     <object name="cactus" gid="31" width="81" height="101"/>
    </template>

Can contain: :ref:`tmx-tileset`, :ref:`tmx-object`

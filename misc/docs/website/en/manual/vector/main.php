  The Vector module brings the t_bunny_vector
  object which encapsulate a resizable array with constructible and destructible
  elements storage.
</p>
<p>
  By being made out of an array, the Vector module is fast when
  you need a random access and is slow when you need to extend its size or to
  shift elements.

The purpose of this binary is to test the efficiency of ciphers.
A single bunny cipher will certainly be really insufficient for different types of data.
It may depend of it heavily: a png does not store clearly its picture for example, so
mixing it a little with a ciphering will not allow ultra simple display of pictures,
but a BMP file may be sensible.

This program does not cipher the whole file, only the picture inside, allowing you
to see how chaos/entropy is generated inside the picture with different algorithm.
